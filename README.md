Power BI is a business analytics tool by Microsoft that allows users to:

Connect to multiple data sources (Excel, SQL, web APIs, etc.).
Transform and clean data to make it ready for analysis.
Visualize data through interactive charts, graphs, maps, and other visuals.
Share reports with colleagues and stakeholders through dashboards or Power BI Service.
Key Features of Power BI Used in This Project:
Data Import and Transformation: The dataset was imported and cleaned using Power BIâ€™s Query Editor. Data transformations include removing duplicates, filtering data, and creating new calculated columns.
Interactive Visuals: Dynamic visuals like bar charts, line charts, and pie charts are used to provide interactive insights. You can filter and drill down into specific data points for detailed analysis.
DAX Functions: Data Analysis Expressions (DAX) are used to create custom calculations, such as calculating the percentage of medals won by gender and filtering top-performing countries.
Slicers and Filters: These are used to allow dynamic interaction with the data. For example, you can filter the data by year, country, or sport to see how the results change.
Why Power BI?
Power BI is ideal for this project because of its ability to:

Handle large datasets efficiently.
Create interactive dashboards that enable users to explore the data in depth.
Simplify complex data with visual storytelling, making it easy to uncover trends and insights.
Allow for easy sharing and collaboration with team members or stakeholders.
